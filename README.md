REDUCE is a system for doing scalar, vector and matrix algebra by computer, 
which also supports arbitrary precision numerical approximation and interfaces 
to gnuplot to provide graphics. It can be used interactively for simple 
calculations but also provides a full programming language, with a syntax similar 
to other modern programming languages. REDUCE supports alternative user interfaces 
including *Emacs* and *TeXmacs*.

Pure-Reduce :rocket:
------
Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation, lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.

Pure is especially suited for *Symbolic Computing* beyond mere *Computer Algebra*
: e.g. [Making Computer Algebra More Symbolic](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~smwatt/pub/reprints/2006-tc-sympoly.pdf) and 
[Symbolic Computation versus Computer Algebra](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~smwatt/pub/reprints/2006-aca-symvsca.pdf)
by [Stephen M. Watt](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~smwatt/).
